# Admission_Predcition
The Admission Prediction model is a neural network trained on historical data, predicting admission chances based on GRE Score, TOEFL Score, University Rating, SOP, LOR, CGPA, and Research. The associated web app, built using Streamlit, offers an intuitive interface for users to input data, explore predictions, visualize feature importances, and understand model decisions. It includes authentication, dynamic feature selection, theme customization, and SHAP values for transparency. Future aspects include enhanced security, model iteration, and collaboration with educational platforms.

The code snippet you provided indicates the use of a simple feedforward neural network model. 
The total number of parameters (weights and biases) in the model is 273. The model uses rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions by default in each dense layer.

As i cannot upload the model, you can execute form the ipynb file i have uploaded her, admission_prediction_model

Also to explain the input characters a bit more, i have attached another ipynb file named admission, which contains all analysis of the input features.

also to execute our webapp you mst run main.py in a suitable python environment.
